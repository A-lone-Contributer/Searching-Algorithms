# LINEAR SEARCH

# Linear search is the most basic searching algorithms out there.It simply does a
# sequential search for the element till the element is found.

# Linear search is not widely used because of presence of more efficient algorithms.

def linear_search(arr, n, key):

    # loop through the whole list
    for i in range(0, n):
    
        # if the current element is the key then element is found
        if arr[i] == key:
        
            print(f"Element present as index {i}")
            
        else:
        
            # if not found
            print("Element not found!")


# Driver code
arr = [2, 3, 34, 56, 12]
n = len(arr)
key = input("Enter the value you want to search: ")
linear_search(arr, n, key)

# Time Complexity: O(n)
# Space Complexity : O(1)
