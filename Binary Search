# BINARY SEARCH

# Search a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
# It works on Subtract and conquer strategy.

# NOTE: The array must be sorted beforehand

# High level Algorithm:

# 1.Begin with an interval covering the whole array.
# 2.If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval,
#  narrow the interval to the lower half. Otherwise narrow it to the upper half.
# 3.Repeatedly check until the value is found or the interval is empty.

# There can be two ways to implement binary search. One is iterative and other is
# recursive. The one discussed below is recursive.


def binary_search(arr, start, end, key):
    # computing the index of middle element
    while end >= 1:
        mid = (start + end) // 2

        # If element to be searched is the middle element
        if arr[mid] == key:
            return mid

        # If element is smaller than mid, then it
        # can only be present in left sub-array so update the start and
        # end according to that
        elif arr[mid] > key:
            # recursive call
            return binary_search(arr, start, end - 1, key)

        # Else the element can only be present
        # in right sub-array so update the start and end according to that
        else:
            # recursive call
            return binary_search(arr, start + 1, end, key)
    # if not present then simply return -1
    return -1


# Driver code
arr = [2, 3, 5, 13, 34, 56]
# Element to be searched
key = 13

# Function call
result = binary_search(arr, 0, len(arr) - 1, key)

if result != -1:
    print(f"Element is present at index : {result}")
else:
    print("Element is not present in array")

# Space Complexity : O(log(n))
# Time Complexity : O(1)
